**Multi-agent conversations:** 
- AutoGen agents can communicate with each other to solve tasks. This allows for more complex and sophisticated applications than would be possible with a single LLM.

**Customization:** 
- AutoGen agents can be customized to meet the specific needs of an application. This includes the ability to choose the LLMs to use, the types of human input to allow, and the tools to employ.

**Human participation:** 
- AutoGen seamlessly allows human participation. This means that humans can provide input and feedback to the agents as needed.
